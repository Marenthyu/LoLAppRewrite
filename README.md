Rewrite of my Application MarLookUp

# Archiving
So, here i am, 4 years since my last commit. This repository will be archived when i finsih writing this and it's an incredible trip back down memory lane.

I've come a way since creating this and it shows - This project is about as bad as you could expect (auto-generated code, plaintext references to API Keys and the like...), yet that one single comment i got ("Your tool just saved my life. Thank you :D" -- BearLord 25/10/2014) made it all worth the hassle.

I'm archiving this to have a future reference to still show this, but to signify that i do not intend to do any kind of development on this project any more - it would be a lot better to start from scratch, the Game has changed so much, basically no code is reusable.

If you're here: Thank you for being interested in my history. If you are interested where i've moved off to, check out my Waifu Trading Card Game in a Twitch Bot! https://waifus.de

Thanks, Maren
